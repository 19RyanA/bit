## What is bit?
**bit** is a tool that lets you send messages in text (called _bits_) through links, and only the first person to go to the link, unless set otherwise, will receive the text.

## Why use bit?
Its anonymous, secure, and private. Its also great for sending great amounts of text shortened to a link.
### Anonymous
bit does not have any identifying features or user tracking.
### Secure
We use 512-bit RSA private-key encryption. No one unauthorized will be able to decrypt your bits.
### Private
Even if you do send the link to someone via an insecure medium, anyone trying to hack into your conversation will not view the message. Why? Unless specifically set otherwise, your bit will delete itself after being read.

## How do I make a bit?
Simple!

1. Go to [our website](http://bitapp.cf/).

2. Enter your message in the big text box.

3. If you want your bit to be permanent (so it does not delete itself after being seen), check "Make Permanent" below the "Create Bit" button.

4. Click on the "Create Bit" button. A link will be given to the bit. Send this to the recipient, and when they visit the link, they will see the text.
